# If the subnet is *statically routed* to your server's main IP, then the
# first address (e.g. x.x.x.200 for subnet x.x.x.200/29) is used to identify
# the network, and the last address (x.x.x.207) is used for broadcast.
# A vnic in the global zone must act as a router for the subnet.
#
# Traffic goes to x.x.x.200, and a vnic on x.x.x.201 routes traffic to the
# subnet.
#
# So the routing (vnic) IP for a x.x.x.200/29 subnet is x.x.x.201
